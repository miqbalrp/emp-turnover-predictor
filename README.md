## Problem definition

**Current Situation:**
HR and managers lack a systematic tool to assess employee churn risk. They rely on intuition and limited data points, leading to:

- **Reactive retention strategies:** Responding to resignations after the fact, missing opportunities to proactively engage and retain valuable talent.
- **Potential talent loss:** Losing "A-player" employees with high institutional knowledge and productivity, leading to significant costs and disruptions.

**Cost Comparison:**

- **Finding new talent:** Studies show replacing an employee can cost 1.5-2 times their annual salary, including recruitment, onboarding, and lost productivity.
- **Retaining an A-player:** Investing in employee engagement, career development, and competitive compensation is often significantly cheaper than replacing them.

**Desired Outcome:**
Develop a machine learning model that predicts the probability of employee resignation and identifies key factors contributing to this risk.

**Key Deliverables:**

- A user-friendly web interface allowing HR/managers to input employee data.
- The interface displays the:
    - Probability of the employee leaving the company.
    - Top factors influencing this prediction, providing actionable insights.

**Impact:**

- **Proactive talent retention strategies:** Identify and address employee concerns before they resign, focusing on high-risk individuals.
- **Improved employee engagement and satisfaction:** Creating a positive work environment reduces churn and attracts top talent.
- **Reduced hiring and training costs:** Saving money associated with replacing lost employees.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Data access and quality.
- Model fairness and interpretability.
- Implementation within existing HR workflows.

**By predicting and addressing potential churn, this project helps companies avoid the significant costs associated with losing valuable employees.**
